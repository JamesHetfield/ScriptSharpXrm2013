ScriptSharpXrm2013
==================

Script Sharp Import Library for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013

Based on this project: http://sharpxrmpage.codeplex.com/

Notes
-----
I have made every effort in this initial release to add the new JavaScript features to the library.  I have removed features that have been removed fron the SDK.  I have also made the decision to remove obsolete features that still remain in the SDK to discourage their use, for example Xrm.Page.context.isOutlookClient.

TODO
----
  * Go through the project and make sure optional parameters are set
  * Add an example project using the assembly
